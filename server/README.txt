Introduction:
	Run car_calibration_server.py to car calibration server routine (calibration values are stored in "server/config")
	Run tcp_server.py for car control GUI server routine.

Notice:
	Before you run the client routine, you must first run the server routine:
	* car_calibration_server.py for car_calibration_client.py
	* tcp_server.py for client_App.py
