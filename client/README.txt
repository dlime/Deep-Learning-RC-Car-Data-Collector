Introduction:
	Run cali_client.py to first perform a calibration of the servos and motor (calibration is stored in "server/config")
	Run client_App.py for car control GUI and to start data collection.

Notice:
	Before you run the client routine, you must first run the server routine:
	* cali_server.py for cali_client.py
	* tcp_server.py for client_App.py
