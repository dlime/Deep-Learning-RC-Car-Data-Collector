Introduction:
	Run car_calibration_client.py to first perform a calibration of the servos and motor
	(calibration values are stored in "server/config")
	Run client_App.py for car control GUI and to start data collection.

Notice:
	Before you run the client routine, you must first run the server routine:
	* car_calibration_server.py for car_calibration_client.py
	* tcp_server.py for client_App.py
